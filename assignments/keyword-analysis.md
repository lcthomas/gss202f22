# Keyword Analysis
* **Due dates: Sunday, October 9 and Sunday, November 6**
    * **The first keyword analysis paper is required for everyone**
* **~1,000-1,500 words**
* **You can choose a citation style, but you should choose one (MLA, Chicago, APA, etc).**
* **Turn in via Blackboard**
* **Download a PDF of this assignment sheet from our class Google drive**

For this assignment, you will select 1 keyword to write about. We will discuss what a “keyword” is in class and keep a running list of keywords from our readings throughout the semester in our class notes and slides folder. I recommend you select a keyword from this list to write about, but you don’t have to (if you want to write about a keyword not from this list, I strongly recommend you clear it with me first). After selecting your keyword, you will then select 2 texts from our course in which this keyword is defined, discussed, depicted, developed, critiqued, and/or extended. You will then write ~1,000-1,500 words analyzing what your chosen keyword means and/or how it is significant in these texts.

If you plan to complete 2 keyword analyses this semester, your second keyword analysis should be about a different keyword and include discussions of different texts (and/or films) than your first keyword analysis. Additionally, if you complete 2 keyword analyses this semester, you may discuss 1 text or film from outside of class in the second keyword analysis you turn in, if you choose (you must stick only to texts assigned in class if you only complete 1 keyword analysis this semester). If you are interested in this option, I strongly recommend you discuss the text or film from outside of class you want to write about with me first.

You have two options for completing this assignment, each of which is described below. No matter which option you choose, you should aim to be as specific as possible in your discussion of your keyword. Rather than providing general summary or description, select specific quotes, scenes, images, or moments to discuss in each text or film in relation to your keyword. In order to receive a grade of “Satisfactory” on this assignment, your analysis must be specific, clearly written and polished, and you must include the required elements described below.

## 1. Select 2 scholarly works, essays, or interviews to write about.
If you select this option, you will analyze your chosen keyword using 2 scholarly works (articles or book chapters written by academics, generally speaking), essays (works of non-fiction, generally speaking), or interviews. The most important factor to consider in selecting your texts for this assignment is that you should select 2 works that differ somehow in their discussions of your chosen keyword. Perhaps your second text builds on the discussion of your keyword in your first text, or perhaps your second text critiques the discussion of your keyword in your first text, or perhaps your second text discusses your keyword in a different context. The possibilities here are endless. But no matter what, you should select 2 texts that differ in how they approach your keyword, and you should be able to articulate this difference in your keyword analysis itself.

Your keyword analysis should contain the following elements:

1.	A discussion of how your first text defines your chosen keyword. What does your keyword mean in this text? Don’t shy away from complexity or contradictions here.
2.	A discussion of how your second text builds on, challenges, critiques, or otherwise extends the discussion of your keyword in the first text. How does this second text define this keyword – or a closely related term or concept – differently, and/or what does it do with this keyword that is different from what the first text does?
3. You should include specific quotes from each text you discuss where appropriate. However, you should not overly rely on these quotes in your writing, and they should not make up the bulk of your analysis; you should put things into your own words as much as possible. When you include a quote from the text, you must be able to explain and analyze it in your own words.

## 2. Select 1 scholarly work, essay, or interview and 1 film or literary work to write about.
If you select this option, you will analyze your chosen keyword using 1 scholarly work (an article or book chapter written by an academic, generally speaking), essay (a work of non-fiction, generally speaking), or interview and 1 film or literary work. See below for a list of films and literary works we are discussing this semester in this class. The most important factor to consider in selecting your texts for this assignment is that you select 2 works that relate to each other in some way. Perhaps the scholarly work, essay, or interview you select defines your chosen keyword, while the film or literary work you select depicts this concept in an interesting or unique way. Or perhaps the film or literary work you select challenges or critiques or re-contextualizes the discussion of your keyword in the scholarly work, essay, or interview you select. Again, the ways that these 2 texts might relate to each other are endless, but you should be able to articulate this relationship in your keyword analysis.

Your keyword analysis should contain the following elements:

1.	A discussion of how your selected scholarly work, essay, or interview defines your chosen keyword. What does your keyword mean in this text? Don’t shy away from complexity or contradictions here.
2.	A discussion of how your selected film or literary work depicts, challenges, and/or extends this keyword or concept. How does your chosen keyword operate in this film or literary text? Does this text conceptualize this keyword differently than your selected scholarly work, essay, or interview, and if so, how? Or does your film or literary text conceptualize your keyword in ways that broadly align with your selected scholarly work, essay, or interview, and if so, how?
3. You should include specific quotes and/or discussions of specific shots, montages, images, and/or sequences from each text or film you discuss where appropriate. However, you should not overly rely on these quotes, etc. in your writing, and they should not make up the bulk of your analysis; you should put things into your own words as much as possible. When you include a quote and/or discussions of specific shots, montages, images, and/or sequences from from a text or a film, you must be able to explain and analyze it in your own words.
